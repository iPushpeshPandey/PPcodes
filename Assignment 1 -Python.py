# ### Assignment 1

# Question no 1

# * is mathematical operator.
# "hello" is a value.
# -87.8 is a value.
# - is a mathematical operator.
# / is a mathematical operator.
# + is a mathematical operator.
# 6 is a value.
# 
# 

# Question 2
# 

# Difference between a string or a variable is as follows
# (1) A string is a mathematrical value whose value is fixed where as a variable is quantity that can 
# assume any value.
# (2) A string is a information that can be strored in any variable where as a variable is something that stores the informations.
# (3) A string is a mathematical value represented in textual format where as a variable can represent any data types.
# 
# 

# Question 3

# In[ ]:


The three different data types are:
    Integers: These are the datatype representing integers as values.
        example: 1,2
    string : These are the datatypes representing text.
        example: 'pushpesh'
    float: These are the datatypes representing the decimal numbers.
        example: 12.1


# Question 4

# In[ ]:


An Expression is a combinations of the mathematical values , operators to produce some other values.
All the expressions store the values or the informations.
example: a string is a expresssion that stores the value of the string.


# Question 5

# spam=10
# is an expression, as it stores the value of spam.
# where as a statement only displays a value its cannot be reduced to a value, it only do the things whivh an expression says.
# 

# Question 6

# In[7]:


bacon=22
bacon+1


# Question 7

# In[5]:


'spam'+'spamspam'


# In[6]:


'spam'*3


# Question 8

# In[ ]:


egg can be a valid name as it does not represnts a value its a statement that can assign any value.
where as 100 is a mathematical value it cannot store any value.


# Question 9

# In[ ]:


for integers we can take an use the function int.
for floating point numbers we can use float.
for string we can use the str function.


# Question 10
# 
The Error here is when we are adding the integer with the string.
so to fix the problem we need to convert the integer data type  to the the string data type

# In[3]:


"i have eaten"+" 99 "+"burritos"
